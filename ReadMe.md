## Dependencies:

**ox_lib:** https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/

**ps-ui:** https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-ui

### Important:

**Dispatch:** There's no dispatch function built into this script, use your own dispatch system (client/framework/dispatch.lua)

**Items:** I'm too lazy to create a list .sql file or list for qbcore, there's only 3 items needed in config add them in your inventory/framework yourself.

**Can you add/edit/improve something from the script for my server?:** Short answer is no.

**I found a bug or I have some improvements for the script, what should I do?:** Open an issue or a pull request in Github or leave a comment in my Forum Post. Don't open a Ticket in Discord, Discord is only for paid scripts.
